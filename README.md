# BrainStation_DataSci_Sprint1
This GitHub repository contains a portfolio of deliverables for Brain Station's Data Science Boot Camp Industry Sprint 1.  The portfolio contains an executive summary (pdf), a presentation slide deck (pdf), a Jupyter notebook with commented Python code used to analyze the dataset, and a Tableau workbook used to generate graphs and charts.  
## Purpose
The purpose of the industry sprint was to apply what was learned in the data science class to tackle a real-world problem with an industry partner. In this case, the industry partner was Canadian fintech corporation Wealthsimple Inc. (WSI). The real-world problem was to analyze a dataset of customer complaints to the American Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for insights into how WSI can grow its market in the financial services industry. The main thrust of the project code was to parse customer narrative data for insights into customer complaints that WSI can leverage to grow its market.  The assignment was a group effort, with guidance from BrainStation data science instructors and an assigned "mentor" from the industry partner, WSI.  
## Challenges
The main challenge was the fact that the data was categorical, limiting opportunities to simply build a regression model to "predict" a solution. Another challenge was the fact that the data was all US based. Wealthsimple operates in Canada, so any geographically based insight the data may have had was irrelevant. A third challenge was the fact that the data did not include any quantitative information on issue resolution time, a tangible key performance indicator (KPI) with which to assess industry competitiveness. 
## Benefits
The major benefits were general familiarity and experience with banking, and the fact that the group members have been in the same class for a few months now and collaborate quite amicably.
